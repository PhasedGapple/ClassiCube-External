# HackMee for ClassiCube
A external for ClassiCube.

## Features

- **Force Noclip**  
  An external Noclip switch

- **Force Hax**  
  Re-enables Hax when a server disables it

- **Description**  
  Lets you view some client info such as FPS, Position (unfinished)

- **Teleport**  
  Lets you teleport to given coordinates

- **Spoof Client**  
  Changes the Client name after rejoining a CPE server (buggy)


## Why doesn't the external work
Make sure you have clicked the **Detect Client** button after going ingame and your ClassiCube exe is called "ClassiCube.exe".<br>
I do not give support on versions older than **ClassiCube 1.3.5**<br>
If you are still having problems, create a **issue** and tell me your ClassiCube version and the issue ur having.<br>

## Dependencies
- Windows
- .NET 6.0 or later
